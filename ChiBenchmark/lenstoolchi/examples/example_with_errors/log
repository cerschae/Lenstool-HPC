The fiducial model is given in test_errors.par

The original sources are in source.cat
The original lensed images are in image.cat
The Gaussian blured images (0.1") are in image2.cat

Note: This is normal that you do not recover exactly an error position of 0.1"
because the number of images in image2.cat is not large enough to be 
statistically significant.

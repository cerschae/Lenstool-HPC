May  3  2006    Correction in f_shape_abs() to handle the errors produced 
		while reading the multiple images files in WCS coordinates.
May 16  2006	Correction of a BUG that was appearing when some keyword 
		arguments where missing in a .par file. In general, the next
		keyword was not considered.
May 16  2006	Correction : In the best.par file, the type argument of the
		reference keyword was always 0. Now it corresponds to its 
		original value.

		functions e_grad_gal(), e_grad2_gal(), e_mag_gal().
Jun 14  2006    Reorganisation of the set_lens_par() and set_lens() functions.
		The set_lens_par() is used only once in init_grille() and 
		display the clumps parameters. It calls the set_lens() function
		to set the clumps parameters. set_lens() is also called in
		o_runpot1() and o_runpot2(). No speed improvement noticed.
Jun 14  2006    Rename the Mcrit and Mcrit12 global constants to MCRIT and 
		MCRIT12.

		the SIS model were free() even if the model was not SIS. It
		was resulting in a malloc error.

		the blue points and the gray pixels.

		is given.
